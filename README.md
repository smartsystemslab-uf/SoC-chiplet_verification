# SoC-chiplet_verification

This repo contains the following:

# 1. SystemC Verification Methododlogy Framework (svm 1.0): svm-main 
	SVM is used to perform early validation of a SoC or chiplet-based
	SiP (System-in-Package). Pull this repo to experiment with the
	baseline design with defualt SoC/Chiplet IPs.

# 2. Example SystemC Example Design: soc_example
	The module is a simple soc design in SystemC. Use to repo to 
	learn about SystemC-based SoC/chiplet design

# 3. Modules: module
	The repo holds systemC IPs (chiplets, or SoC). This repo is added as a submodule 
        to the svm-main to reference the SoC/chiplet designs.
