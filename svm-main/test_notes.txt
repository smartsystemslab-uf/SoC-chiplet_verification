SystemC-based SoC/chiplet Verification System
Version: svm1.0 (SystemC Verifcation Methodology) 
Peter Mbua

Description: Provide commands to run the design 
A. Build and Compile design 
	python3 tools/run.py tests/dsl/quick_sanity.dsl.yaml
OR
	cd ~/systemc_dev/svm
	cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	cmake --build build -j
	./build/uvm_lite_sim
	

Function: 

1. Generates tests:
This command invokes toosl/dsl2tests.py to transalte user-provided DSL file (YAML) into per-IP JSON suites under 
tests/generated 

2.Builds the simulator (if not already built) 
Calls CMake to compile the SystemC framework and create build/sim/uvm_lite_sim

3. Runs the verification simulation 
Executes the compiled binary with SystemC, orchestrating the sequencer and agents

B. Run generated cpp binary 

	./generated_file (e.g uvm_lite)
